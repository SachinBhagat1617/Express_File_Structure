## Project Name - Node.js Project Template

This project provides a well-organized and efficient template to streamline your Node.js application development. It adheres to best practices for code structure, maintainability, and scalability.

### Getting Started

1. **Download or Clone:**
   - Download or clone the template from its source (replace with specific instructions based on your template's location).
   - Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Navigate to the project's root directory and run:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - This installs the necessary dependencies listed in `package.json`.

3. **Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory (exclude this file from version control).
   - Add environment variables like `PORT` for server port assignment.
   - Example:
     ```
     PORT=3000
     ```

4. **Database Setup (Optional):**
   - If using a database:
     - Navigate to the `src/config` directory.
     - If using Sequelize (or another ORM):
       - Run:
         ```bash
         npx sequelize init
         ```
       - Follow the prompts to configure your database connection details (username, password, dialect).
       - Update `config/config.json` with your actual database information.

5. **Start Development Server:**
   - Run the script defined in `package.json` (typically `npm run dev`) to start the Node.js server in development mode. This might involve starting a local development server or building your application for production.

### Project Structure

The project follows a clear and modular structure:

- **src** (source code):
   - **config** (configurations):
     - Configuration for environment variables (`server-config.js`), logging libraries, and other application-wide settings.
   - **routes** (API endpoints):
     - Routing definitions for your application's API endpoints.
   - **middlewares** (request intercepting functions):
     - Logic for validation, authentication, authorization, and other request processing tasks.
   - **controllers** (business logic handlers):
     - Receive incoming requests, handle data processing, and interact with services for business logic execution.
     - Structure and send API responses.
   - **repositories** (database interaction):
     - Data access layer using raw database queries or an ORM.
   - **services** (business logic):
     - Encapsulate core business logic, including interacting with repositories and other services.
   - **utils** (helper functions):
     - Reusable helper functions for common tasks, error handling, etc.
- **tests** (optional but highly recommended):
  - Unit and integration tests for individual components and overall application functionality.
- **.env** (environment variables):
  - Stores sensitive configuration data like database credentials, API keys, or ports.
- **package.json** (dependencies and scripts):
  - Lists required Node.js modules and defines scripts for project management tasks.
- **README.md** (documentation): You're reading it!

### Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project! Please follow the guidelines outlined in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file (create one if it doesn't exist).

This `README.md` file provides a basic overview of the project. Feel free to extend it with more detailed information specific to your project, such as:

- API documentation for your endpoints.
- Usage examples for developers using your project.
- Additional configuration options or environment variables.
- Specific instructions for running tests or building the application for production.

By following these guidelines and adapting them to your project's needs, you'll create a well-documented and easy-to-use starting point for your Node.js development.
